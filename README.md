Natural Language Processing Project

### Project Description:

- The Aim of this project is investigating Meta-Learning techniques (Metric and Prototype variants) to make Bert produce a latent space of popular song lyrics (downloaded from Genius). In this space song lyrics are close either because it semantical similarity or because they are made by the same artist.
- These techniques could be easily thought as part of a back-end for a Song Reccomendation System.
