Natural Language Processing Project

### Project Description:

- The Aim of this project is investigating Meta-Learning techniques (Metric and Prototype variants) to create a metric which computes a distance between popular song lyrics (downloaded from Genius). 
- These techniques could be easily thought as part of a back-end for a Song Reccomendation System.
