'bout it felt like home somehow\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n'Caus\u0435 there we ar\u0435 again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKeychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town\nAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down, \"Any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love,\" you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\nYou might also like\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up\nRunnin' scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of bein' honest\nI'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weepin' in a party bathroom\nSome actress askin' me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nAnd I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it (All too well)\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it217Embed"},{"artist":"Taylor

star, love\nYou shouldn't have to deal with that\nI'd never make you feel like that\n'Cause\n\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give, but you cannot take love\nYeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive\nPassive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance\nI look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping\nI like when money makes a difference but don't make you different\nStarted realizing a couple places I could take it\nI want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement\nI want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation\nAnd influence a generation that's lacking in patience\nI've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience\nJust me and my old man getting back to basics\nWe've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted\nWhen he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing\nWell, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas\nWe might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us\nWe even talked about you and our couple of moments\nHe said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups\nYou a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone\nLooking like you came from the seventies on your own\nMy mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is\n\"Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?\"\nYou don't even know what you want from love anymore\nI search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored\nBut girl, what qualities was I looking for before?\nWho you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?\nYou might also like\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give, but you cannot take love\nUh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures\nOr further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage\nWhen I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit\nA weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it\n'Cause that night I played her three songs\nThen we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on\nThen she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz\nBoy, was she wrong\nThat was just negative energy for me to feed off\nNow it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria\nOr Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria\nLandmarks of the muses that inspired the music\nWhen I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it\nThe one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree\nI've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me\nNow she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?\nKnow we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?\nRemember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz\nGirl, I felt like we had it all planned out\nI guess I fucked up the vision\nLearning the true consequences of my selfish decisions\nWhen you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven\nIt seem like you don't want this love anymore\nI'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore\nBut girl, what qualities was I looking for before?\nWho you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give, but you cannot take love\n\nBeen Baka aka Not Nice from time, G\nBeen a East Side ting\nScarborough ting from time, G\nBeen have up di ting dem from time,

day we won't pay your debt\nOur centipedes will get theirs yet\n\nPoachers in your home\nPoachers in your home\nPoachers in your home\nPoachers in your home2Embed"},{"artist":"Mars Volta","lyrics":"Blacklight Shine Lyrics\nYou would be gone if it weren't for what I know\nHelp me out of this godforsaken cure\n\nIf that rain don't fall any sooner, I'm gonna wash up on the shore\nIf that train don't run any sooner, I'm gonna waste away\nInto lantern jaws\n\nLastimado sentimiento en mi cinturita\nDame rabia, dame todo el dolor\nKarma tarda en llegar pero llegar\u00e1\nLo vas a pagar\nIf that rain don't fall any sooner, I'm gonna wash up on the shore\nIf that train don't run any sooner, I'm gonna waste away\nInto lantern jaws\n\nY lo gritos van\nBaila si quieres m\u00e1s\nEn pedazos quebrado\nMe entregaste una vida de enga\u00f1os\nLo vas a pagar\n\nIf that rain don't fall any sooner, I'm gonna wash up on the shor\u0435\nIf that train don't run any sooner, I'm gonna waste away\nInto lantern jaws\n\nR\u0435seeding the desert, the high control hex\nHe obsessively pets with his thumbs\nThinking no one's watching\nBut I got the copy that he can never erase\nHe's fit for a crypt\nA place for the errors in judgment that he can afford\nAnd I am that moment that you never saw comin'\nYou might also like\nAnd every fingerprint you answered for (For, for)\nI'll shine the blackest light to the culprit on all fours\n\nIf that rain don't fall any sooner, I'm gonna wash up on the shore\nIf that train don't run any sooner, I'm gonna waste away\nIf that rain don't fall any sooner, I'm gonna wash up on the shore\nIf that train don't run any sooner, I'm gonna waste away\nInto lantern jaws1Embed"}]
