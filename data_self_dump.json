Cash","lyrics":""},{"artist":"Johnny Cash","lyrics":"One Piece at a Time Lyrics\nWell, I left Kentucky back in '49\nAnd went to Detroit working on assembly line\nThe first year they had me putting wheels on Cadillacs\nEvery day I'd watch them beauties roll by\nAnd sometimes I'd hang my head and cry\nBecause I always wanted me one that was long and black\nOne day I devised myself a plan\nThat should be the envy of most any man\nI'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand\nNow getting caught meant getting fired\nBut I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired\nI'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand\nI'd get it one piece at a time\nAnd it wouldn't cost me a dime\nYou'd know it's me when I come through your town\nI'm going to ride around in style\nI'm going to drive everybody wild\nBecause I'll have the only one there is around\n\nSo the very next day when I punched in\nWith my big lunchbox, and with help from my friend\nI left that day with a lunchbox full of gears\nI've never considered myself a thief\nBut GM wouldn't miss just one little piece\nEspecially if I strung it out over several years\nThe first day I got me a fuel pump\nAnd the next day I got me an engine and a trunk\nThen I got me a transmission and all of the chrome\nThe little things I could get in my big lunchbox\nLike nuts, and bolts, and all four shocks\nBut the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home\nNow, up to now my plan went all right\nUntil we tried to put it all together one night\nAnd that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong\nThe transmission was a '53\nAnd the motor turned out to be a '73\nAnd when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone\nSo we drilled it out so that it would fit\nAnd with a little bit of help from an a-daptor kit\nWe had that engine running just like a song\nNow the headlights, they was another sight\nWe had two on the left and one on the right\nBut when we pulled out the switch all three of them come on\nThe back end looked kind of funny too\nBut we put it together and when we got through\nWell, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin\nAbout that time my wife walked out\nAnd I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts\nBut she opened the door and said \"Honey, take me for a spin\"\nSo we drove up town just to get the tags\nAnd I headed her right on down main drag\nI could hear everybody laughing for blocks around\nBut up there at the courthouse they didn't laugh\nBecause to type it up it took the whole staff\nAnd when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds\nYou might also like\nI got it one piece at a time\nAnd it didn't cost me a dime\nYou'll know it's me when I come through your town\nI'm going to ride around in style\nI'm going to drive

ask his business, no one dared to make a slip\nFor the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip\nBig iron on his hip\nIt was early in the morning when he rode into the town\nHe came ridin' from the south side, slowly lookin' all around\nHe's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip\nAnd he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip\nBig iron on his hip\nIn this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red\nMany men had tried to take him and that many men were dead\nHe was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty-four\nAnd the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more\nOne and nineteen more\nNow the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around\nHe was an Arizona Ranger, wouldn't be too long in town\nHe came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead\nAnd he said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red\nAfter Texas Red\nThe morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet\nIt was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street\nFolks were watching from their windows, everybody held their breath\nThey knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death\nWas about to meet his death\nThere was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play\nAnd the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today\nTexas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped\nAnd the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip\nThe big iron on his hip\nBig iron, big iron\nWhen he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip\nThe big iron on his

Lyrics\nJohn Henry's Papy woke him up one midnight\nHe said before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you, listen boy\nSaid learn to ball a jack, learn to lay a track, learn to pick and shovel too, and take my hammer, it'll do anything you tell it to\nJohn Hery's mammie had about a dozen babies, John Henry's papie told tale about a dozen times\nThe babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money, he said I'll pay you quarter at a time, startin' tomorow, that's the pay for a steel driver on this line\nThen the section foreman said hey hammer swinger, I see you brought your own hammer boy, but what else can all those muscles do?\nAnd he said, I can turn a jack, I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too\n(can you swing a hammer boy?)\nI can I'll do anything you hire me to\nNow ain't you something so high and mighty with your muscles, just go ahead pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer\nHe said get a rusty spike and swing it down three times, I'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to, go on and do what you say you can do\nWith a steep nose hammer on a four foot switch panel, John Henry raised it back till it touched his heels, then the spike went through the cross tie and it split it half in two, 35 cents a day for driven steel\n(sweat sweat boy, sweat, you owe me two more swings)\nI was born for driven steel\nWell John Henry hammered in the mountain, he'd give a grunt and he'd give groan with every swing, the women folks for miles around, heard him and come down, to watch him make the cold steel ring, Lord what a swinger, just listen to that cold steel ring\nBut the bad boss come up laughing at John Henry, said you full of vinegar now, but you bout through, were gonna get a steam drill to do your share of drivin, then what's all them muscles gonna do, huh John Henry, gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you\nJohn Henry said I feed four little brothers, and my baby sister's walking on her knees, did the Lord say that machines awtta take the place of living, and what's a subsitute for bread and beans, I ain't seen it, do engines get rewarded for their steam\nJohn Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner now, had thirty minutes to rest before the bell, the mine boss hollered get up whoever you are and get a pick ax, give me enough coal to start another hill, and keep it burning, mine me enough to start another hill\nJohn Henry said to his captain, a man ain't nothin but a man, but if you bring that steam drill round, I'll beat it fair and honest, I'll die with my hammer in my hand, but I'll be laughing, cuz you can't replace a steel driven man\nThere was a big crowd of people at the mountain, John Henry said to the steam drill how is you, pardon me mister steam drill, I suppose you didn't hear me, I said how you, well can you turn a jack, can you lay a track, can you pick and shovel too, listen this hammer swingers talkin' to you\n2000 people hollered go John Henry, then somebody hollered the mountain's caving in, John Henry told the captain, tell the kind folks not to worry, that ain't nothin but my hammer suckin' wind, keeps me breathing, a steel drivers muscle I intend\nCaptain tell the people move back further, I'm at the finish line and I ain't no drill, she's so far behind you ain't got the brains to quit it, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills, Lord Lordy, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills\nWell John Henry had a little woman, I believe the lady's name was Polly Ann, yeah that was his good woman, John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home, he layed down to rest his weary back and early next morining he said come here Polly Ann come here sugar, ya know I believe this is the first time I ever watched the sun come up that I couldn't come up with it\nTake my hammer Polly Ann and go to that rail road, swing that hammer like you seen me do it, and when your swinging with the lead men, they'll all know they'll all know your John Henry's woman, but tell them that's not all I can do, tell em I can hoist a jack, and I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too, ain't no machine can, that's been proved to you\nThere was a big crowd of mourners at the church house, the section hands laid him in the sand, trains go by on the rails John Henry laid, they slow down and take off their hats, the men do, when they come to the palce John Henrys laid, rests on his back, some say mornin steel driver you sure were a hammer swinger, then they go along pickin up speed, clikty clak, clikty clak, down there lies a steel driven man

fancy dining car\nThey're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars\nWell I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free\nBut those people keep a-movin' and that's what tortures me\nWell if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine\nI bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line\nFar from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay\nAnd I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues awayYou might also likeEmbed"},{"artist":"Johnny Cash","lyrics":"I Got Stripes Lyrics\nOn A Monday I Was Arrested (Uh Huh)\nOn A Tuesday They Locked Me In The Jail (Oh Boy)\nOn A

letters together and get to talkin' reckless\nOwl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace\nMy life's a completed checklist\nI'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now\nJust

in the clouds on my last album cover?\nThe game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive\nLil Wayne could not have found him a better successor\nEvery shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested\nAllen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question\nLast night I went to sleep wanting more\nTryna decide what direction I should go towards\nSome nights I wish I could go back in life\nNot to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice\n28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me\nLongevity, wonder how long they'll check for me\nProlly forever if I stay in my zone\nI speak on this generation, but can't change it alone\nI heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe\nThat's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside\nOh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage\nYou need to act your age and not your girl's age\nIt gets worse by the annual\nMy career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man\nOh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah\nI know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em\nTo show they outfits off, guess they need the attention\nI remember when it used to be music that did it\nBut then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?\nI'm managed by my friends that I grew up with\nI'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with\nIf me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'\nWe'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on\nBut here we are, yeah\nLately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence\nThey scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments\nBitches alter my messages like we had words\nAnd stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve\nBitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing\nCrazy this year\u2014fuckin' with my image\nI've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year\nFuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year\nAnd I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot\n'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block\nNobody lookin' out for nobody\nMaybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody\nInstead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it\nAnd then they start to \"R.I.P.\" about it\nAnd four weeks later nobody even speaks about it\nDamn, I just had to say my piece about it\nOh, you gotta love it\u2014\nBut they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject\nI been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget\nI gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins\nShout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca\nJulia, Ericka, Southern America\nPart of my heritage, pardon my arrogance\nPart in my hair again, that's that comeback flow\nComeback flow, once I start it's apparent\nI'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'\nBut fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement\nYour content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?\nShit is gettin' so personal in your verses too\nI wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas\nBein' number two is just being the first to lose\nMy city dictated music, nobody seein' us\nWinter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up\nBeen observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough\nLet's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup\nYeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all\nYou rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all\n\"Best I Ever Had\" seems like a decade ago\nDecadent flow and I still got a decade to go\nOh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?\nWhy you rappin' like you come from the streets?\nI got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees\nAnd I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves\nPhantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease\nI cook the beef well done on the double with cheese\nSpecial order for anybody that's comin' for me\nShit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze\nYou see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me\nCuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free\nI'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat\nFeel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats\nMan, oh, you gotta love it, yeah\nAnd on top of that it's getting harder to eat\nRappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease\nTo think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me\nAnd now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe\nBut, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)\nYeah\nAnd head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)\nI know your girl well, just not in public\nBlame the city, I'm a

like you've been down the same road\nJust follow me, I'll get you there\nYou can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em\nBut you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em\n'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem\nWhen I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think\nI'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world\nFeed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me\nI'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly\nAnd all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony\nNo ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he\nFrom Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's\nStill shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly\nUntil he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him\nWhichever comes first, for better or worse\nHe's married to the game\nLike a \"fuck you\" for Christmas, his gift is a curse\nForget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt\nAnd fuck the whole universe\n\nI'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)\nTo take a stand (To take a stand)\nEverybody (Everybody)\nCome take my hand (Come take my hand)\nWe'll walk this road together, through the

shit, and cut the crap\nI shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap\nYou said you was king, you lied through your teeth\nFor that, fuck your feelings\nInstead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped\nAnd to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back\nI promise to never go back on that promise\nIn fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was \"ehh\"\nPerhaps I ran them accents into the ground\nRelax, I ain't goin' back to that now\nAll I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!\n'Cause I ain't playin' around\nThere's a game called circle and I don't know how\nI'm way too up to back down\nBut I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out\nThought I had it mapped out\nBut I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around\nBut it's time to exorcise these demons\nThese ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now\n\nI'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)\nTo take a stand (To take a stand)\nEverybody (Everybody)\nCome take my hand (Come take my hand)\nWe'll walk this road together, through the storm\nWhatever weather, cold or warm\nJust lettin' you know that you're not alone\nHolla if you feel like you've been down the same road\nAnd I just can't keep livin' this way\nSo startin' today\nI'm breakin' out of this cage\nI'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons\nI'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground\nI've had enough, now I'm so fed up\nTime to put my life back together right now\n\nIt was my decision to get clean, I did it for me\nAdmittedly I probably did it subliminally for you\nSo I could come back a brand-new me\nYou helped see me through\nAnd don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you\nI've been through the wringer\nBut they can do little to the middle finger\nI think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of\nMy world, haters can make like bees with no stingers\nAnd drop dead: no more beef lingers\nNo more drama from now on, I promise\nTo focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father\nSo I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it\nYou couldn't lift a single shingle on it\n'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club\nOr the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up\n'Cause I'm raisin' the bar\nI'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars\nI feel amazin', and I'm\u2014\n\nI'm not afraid (I'm not

fire\nToday's a painful re-\nMinder of why\nIt can only get brighter\nThe further you put it behind ya\nBut right now I'm on the\nInside lookin' out, \u2018cause\u2014\n\nI'm standin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nTo find the light, find the light, find the light\nStandin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\nYesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after\nYour world is torn in half, you wake in its wake\nTo start the mourning process and rebuilding, you're still a work in progress\nToday's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous asthma\nThunderstorm has passed ya, you weathered it and poked its\nEye out with the thornbush that ya used to smell the roses\nStopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is stuffed\nSo focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal\nAnd hit the corner faster, more assertive, never looking back\nMay hit the curb, but every day's a new learning curve as ya\nSteer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to\nTo avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage\n\u2018Cause they hurt you so bad it's like they murdered your ass\nAnd threw dirt on your casket, but you've returned from the ashes\nAnd that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline\nAnd while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chantin'\n\nI'm standin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nTo find the light, find the light, find the light\nStandin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\nYou might also like\nYou're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like\nIt happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life\nAnd it's as though you feel you've died, 'cause you've been killed inside\nBut yet you're still alive, which means you will survive\nAlthough today you may weep \u2018cause you're weak and\nEverything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'\nIt begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'\nYou from leapin' off the motherfreakin' deep end\nAnd I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling\nAnd with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow\nYou may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em\nEven after all the shit you've been put through, this feeling of resilience is building\nAnd the flames are burnin' quick as fire would through this building\nYou're sealed in, but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it\nAnd as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin', you look down, \u2018cause you're so over 'em\nYou could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling\n\nAs time passes, things change every day\nBut wounds, wounds heal but scars still remaining the same\nBut tomorrow, today's going down in flames\nThrow the match, set the past ablaze\n\nSo feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even\nPerspire from the heat, exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief\nAnd as you say goodbye to the grief, it's like watching the walls melt\nIn your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin' hell\nStill, a little piece of you dies as you scream\u2014\nI'm standin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nTo find the light, find the light, find the light\nStandin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\n\nI feel the burn\nWatch the smoke as I turn, rising\nA phoenix from the flames\nI have learned\nFrom fighting fights that weren't mine\nIt's not with fists\nBut with wings that I will fly\n\nAnd I'm standin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nTo find the light, find the light, find the light\nStandin' in the flames\nAnd it\u2019s a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the

river\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nIt's 2002, everything was totally new\nWe were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof\nWe wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included\nA multitude of homies who would pounce for no good excuse\nWe were so bulletproof\u2014wrote, souped, and soaked in our youth\nThought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe\nThe death of Doody broke us in two\nWe were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do\nAnd at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too\nSo I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through\nEveryone tried to go solo, really nobody blew\nI was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew\nThe plan was put everyone in position so that they knew\nHow to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds\nI just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth\n'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group\nShoot!\nIf I could leave this all behind\nI could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\nDown to the river with you\nHelp me leave this all behind\n\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom it I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nEnd up runnin' back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\nIt was never the same, and it's bothered me since\nAnd the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets\nThe more time goes by, the more life happens\nAnd we gotta be men, we got responsibilities\nPlus we don't say how we feel\nAnd I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in\nBeen with you guys thick and thin\nBut it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends\nWhich reminded me, Biz, \"Rockstar\" was the shit\nY'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit\nIf you'da put D12 on it, wish I coulda did\nPorter tried talkin' you into comin' up off it\nI know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is\nI think of all of the trips to BET\nAnd the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with\nMaybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features\nBut that's water under the bridge\nBut I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed\nYou might also like\nIf I could leave this all behind\nI could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\nDown to the river with you\nHelp me leave this all behind\n\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom it I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nEnd up runnin' back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\nBacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end\nOne minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits\nYou can already sense the climate is startin' to shift\nTo these kids you no longer exist\nWent from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch\nTo tiny drops, little drips\nAnd by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed\nYou start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed\nAll the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get\nFor turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva, and Swift?\nA Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished\nI ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment\nBut it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none\nI just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this\nTo my partners, I can't say how sorry I am\nThis is not how I planned for our story to end\nI love all of you men\nBut I just can't be the guy everybody depends\nOn for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair\nI will always be here, but that spark isn't there\nAnd I don't know how to recapture that time and that era\nI've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air\nI'm barely chartin' myself\nFeels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent\nTo treat y'all like a stepping stone\nThough I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road\nDone all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up\nBut the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live\nThe less is left for closure, so let's let this go\nIt's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom it I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nEnd up runnin' back into them all\nI never meant to use

why stop?\nOverkill lik\u0435 a pipe bomb in your pine box\nYou're all hitched to my cock (What?)\nWent from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot\nThen treated it like a cyclops\nLike it's the only one I (Only one eye) got\nAnd my thoughts are like nines cocked (Chk-chk)\nEvery line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked\nThat's why there's parental advising (Visine) every time I drop (Eye drop)\nSo throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal\nBut how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?\nBitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out\nPlus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out\nThe filthiest, so all this talk about I'm washed up, how preposterous\nBecause if cleanliness is next to godliness\nIt's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself\nAnd I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun\nStill on top the pile\nGot me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial\nQuick to call you out on your bullshit\nDon't make me give that crock a dial\n'Cause if I do it, see you later, alligator\nMade it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one\nSo hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account\nSo here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the\nBars that never slack (Yeah), but always get attacked (Yeah)\nI think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that\nLike I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit\n'Cause I have this target on my back (Ew, yuck)\nBut if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans\nI'd probably pop five Xans (Yeah)\nGo in my garage, start my van\nInhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can\nAnd doze off like *snores*\nBut odds like that, with these thoughts I have's like a giant getting squashed by ants\nIf this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors\nLike I just tossed my crayons (Tossed my crayons)\nSmall, medium, and large size cans\nSanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands\nWhich is a small price for Lysol wipes and\nIf my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands\nShit, hold on, man\nMotherfuck\nHappy birthday to\u2014\nFuck (Shh, quiet)\n\nI sit in silence in candlelit environments\nSipping Wild Irish while getting violent\nHomicidal visions when I'm spitting like this\nBut really I'm just fulfilling my

recognize, oh\nThese things are clear to all from time to time, ooh\nOh, oh\nAh, talk, talk, talk, talk\nHey!\nI've felt the coldness of my winter\nI never thought it would ever go\nI cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon us\nBut I know that I love you so, ohhhh, oh\nBut I know that I love you so\n\nThese are the seasons of emotion\nAnd like the wind, they rise and fall\nThis is the wonder of devotion\nI see the torch we all must hold\nThis is the mystery of the quotient, quotient\nAh, upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall\nJust a little rain, oh yeah\nUhh, ooh, yeah

there\nI remember it all too well\n\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKeychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town\nAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down, \"Any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love,\" you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\nYou might also like\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up\nRunnin' scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of bein' honest\nI'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weepin' in a party bathroom\nSome actress askin' me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nAnd I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too

bent right to your wind\nBut I come back stronger than a '90s trend\n\nWait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark\nShow me the places where the others gave you scars\nNow this is an open-shut

in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\n\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing

trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow, you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it

ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere\nFell behind all my classmates and I ended up here\nPouring out my heart to a stranger\nBut I didn't pour the whiskey\n\nI just wanted you to know that this is me trying\nI just wanted you to know that this is me trying\n\nAt least I'm trying\n\nAnd it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound\nIt's hard to be anywhere these days when

you for a lifetime\nLeave it all behind\nAnd there is happiness\n\nTell me, when did your winning smile\nBegin to look like a smirk?\nWhen did all our lessons start to look like weapons\nPointed at my deepest hurt?\nI hope she'll be a beautiful fool\nWho takes my spot next to you\nNo, I didn't mean that\nSorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury\nYou haven't met the new me yet\n\nThere'll be happiness after me\nBut there was happiness because of me\nBoth of these things, I believe\nThere is happiness\nYou might also like\nIn our history, across our great divide\nThere is a glorious

paid for seven years in Heaven\nAnd I pulled your body into mine\nEvery goddamn night, now I get fake niceties\nNo one teaches you what to do\nWhen a good man hurts you\nAnd you know you hurt him too\n\nHoney, when I'm above the trees\nI see it for what it is\nBut now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head\nAfter giving you the best I had\nTell me what to give

became the butt of the joke\nI wounded the good and I trusted the wicked\nClearing the air, I breathed in the smoke\nMaybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down\nMaybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town\nThrew out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now\nIt's brighter now, now\n\nI don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you\n(I can never look

not making you my centerfold\nOver and over\nLost again with no surprises\nDisappointments, close your eyes\nAnd it gets colder and colder\nWhen the sun goes down\n\nThe question pounds my head\nWhat's a lifetime of achievement\nIf I pushed you to the edge?\nBut you were too polite to leave me\nAnd do you miss the rogue\nWho coaxed you into paradise and left you there?\nWill you forgive my soul\nWhen you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?\n\n'Cause we were like the mall before the internet\nIt was the one place to be\nThe mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams\nSorry for not winning you an arcade ring\n\nOver and over\nLost again with no surprises\nDisappointments, close your eyes\nAnd it gets colder and colder\nWhen the sun goes down\nYou might also like\nWere you waiting at our old spot\nIn the tree line\nBy the gold clock\nDid I leave you hanging every single day?\nWere you standing in the hallway\nWith a big cake, happy birthday\nDid I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?\nA universe away\nAnd when I got into the accident\nThe sight that flashed before me was your face\nBut when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name\n\nI'm on a bench in Coney Island\nWondering where did my baby go?\nThe fast times, the bright lights, the merry go\nSorry for not making you my centerfold\n\nOver and over\nLost again with no surprises\nDisappointments, close your eyes\nAnd it gets colder and colder\nWhen the sun goes down\nWhen the sun goes down\nThe sight that flashed before me was your face\nWhen the sun goes down\nBut I think that I forgot to say your name\nOver and over\nSorry for not making you my, making you my\nMaking you my centerfold51Embed"},{"artist":"Taylor

closed, drank my poison all alone\nYou said I have to trust more freely\nBut diesel is desire, you were playing with fire\nAnd maybe it's the past that's talking\nScreaming from the crypt\nTelling me to punish you for things you never did\nSo I justified it\n\nAll that bloodshed, crimson clover\nUh-huh, the bombs were closer\nMy hand was the one you reached for\nAll throughout the Great War\nAlways remember\nUh-huh, the burning embers\nI vowed not to fight anymore\nIf we survived the Great War\n\nUh-huh, uh-huh\n\nIt turned into something bigger\nSomewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed\nYour finger on my hairpin triggers\nSoldier down on that icy ground\nLooked up at me with honor and truth\nBroken and blue, so I called off the troops\nThat was the night I nearly lost you\nI really thought I'd lost you\nYou might also like\nWe can plant a memory garden\nSay a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair\nThere's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair\nAnd we

situation that needs to be handled\nI'm fine with my spite\nAnd my tears, and my beers and my candles\nI can feel you smoothing me over\n\nYes, I got your letter\nYes, I'm doing bett\u0435r\nIt cut deep to know ya, right to the bone\nYes, I got your l\u0435tter\nYes, I'm doing better\nI know that it's over, I don't need your\nClosure, your closure\nYour closure, your closure\n\nI know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life\nStaying friends would iron it out so nice\nGuilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea\nThat you put between you and me\nBut it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary\n\nYes, I got your letter\nYes, I'm doing better\nIt cut deep to know ya, right to the bone\nYes, I got your letter\nYes, I'm doing better\nI know that it's over, I don't need your\nClosure, closure, your

shell of a goat head strangled in copper wire, scraped of its insides, unwashed behind the ears, fueling the crooked names spoken by leeches\nTo a thinning cowlick's fat his crippled limp, dragging along the hump of the floor. Sobbing from the smacking mouth of the demagogue wells, making wisecracks, spilling from the corners with their pink flinches, second glancing their every move\nIt ate pickled nose cartilage that fell from the ceilings, a pork skin drizzle unnerving the humans, while it read aloud from its favorite books, in glossolalia slang and haruspex truths, following a slow and patient wait, a mocking their hair as it was glued to their upper lip combover\nUnder the wall, the ships smeared by faithfully talking the magnum fanatics and their bottles of scalp soup\nThey cooked up a tardis smudge on their eyes, a lunar antidote that powdered underneath the oncoming pestilence of their idling fingers\nIt wrote them a seance, penetrated their every dependent desire\nIt hacked off the central headpiece to the collective\nIt wrote them a message in the marrow of the knife, with the extension of Baphomet* transfusion\nGlued to the animals, perversions of their former selves, patiently biting their fingernails looking for a clue\nAs soon as it failed to appear, the faithful fell under the spell of public execution\nIt had been an eternity filled with useless ritual, and all for nothing, promising salvation, but only flags came swarming around for a better taste\nWhat was left were the scraps, dressed in animal skin, defiled servants holding their breath, fatherless culprits blaming their kin, waiting for an answer\nThey thought a day would come, or a giraffe might choke in midair squeal, some sort of indication\nOnly it was the hands of the followers that had left their markings in neatly packed dunes filled with the decapitated remains, found sealed in sand\nIt only stained the conscious for a brief moment, then came disgust\nRealizing there was nothing to it, people began collapsing in collective states of drought\nPalm-size vents heating in the chest, cluttering the graph, a bladder full of remains\nNothing became of them because nothing was the reason, an apathetic display dripping into vats of obesity\nThe feud had been sucking teeth for some time now, but the only baggage that paraded about was the curtain epidermis unfolded in an inebriated suit\nThe fit came suffocating, feathering the boa-constricted paleness, frostbitten, and shovel-faced\nIt came before them in utter confidence, flares of pink owls in the nest of albino eyelids blinking out chemical obscurities to the blind\nIt bloomed into a hemorrhaged contraption that impopulated the disenchanted, one by one\nAll the churches were converted into quarantine facilities, inside them grew bacterial stubble compacted by larvae, contracting and teething\nA newborn litter degradively sufficient, running from the horse collarbone, amongst the murmuring femurs whimpering in fractures\n\"Are you the Polaroid shot you thought you were?\", it said with a coy smirk\nWith the position now vacant, it waltzed right in and made itself at home\nSeduced by the empty nominations at the altar of broken ballot boxes, closer to that nothingness that everyone seemed to embrace\nAs it pissed all over them, the sigh of relief steamed off the soaking depressants, an impending sleep was on its
